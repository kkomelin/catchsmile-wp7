Catch a Smile Windows Phone 7 application (demo project for DrupalConf Moscow 2012)

This is simple app that allows to take photo and upload it to Drupal site through web services.

I developed it for my presentation at DrupalConf Moscow 2012 (02.06.2012).

This application requires web services of catchsmile module https://github.com/konstantin-komelin/catchsmile and Drupal 7.
