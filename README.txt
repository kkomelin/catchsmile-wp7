Catch a Smile Windows Phone 7 application 

Part of demo project for DrupalConf Moscow 2012 (02.06.2012).

This is simple app that allows to take photo and upload it to Drupal site through web services.

This application depends on catchsmile module for Drupal 7 https://github.com/konstantin-komelin/catchsmile.

Application settings are located in Resources/AppResources.resx .

I provide the app "AS IS" without any warranty.
